# QORE

QAMRA-Core (QORE) is an attempt to provide the technical platform for the archiving efforts undertaken by QAMRA. This is a fast evolving project which would take shape as a set of APIs, front-end application or possibly even as a protocol that enables archiving (both offline and online) and digital exhibition.

## Feature list

The features are specified under MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT that are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). This is done to prioritize the feature list and to help carve out a protocol spec at a later stage.

### SHOULD

* Security and conditional access: The artifacts in the archive could be of sensitive nature. Access control and security is essential.
